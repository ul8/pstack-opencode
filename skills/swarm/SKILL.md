> **OpenCode host:** Use OpenCode tools (`task`, `skill`, `bash`, `read`, `edit`, `write`, `grep`, `glob`, `webfetch`). Spawn `poteto-agent` / `comment-sicko` via the `task` tool. If `task` is denied, stay in-parent and report the dropout — do not fake a panel. See `host-contract.md`.

# Swarm

Fan out N parallel workers via `task`. They may cover separate slices, race the same brief, or mix both. The parent waits, aggregates, and returns one report.

## Start

Open a todolist with one entry per phase before launching anything.

1. Frame
2. Fan out
3. Aggregate
4. Report

## Phase A: Frame

1. State the done predicate and the artifact or report the swarm must return.
2. Choose the shape. Partition into slices, race N workers on identical briefs, or mix both. For a race or mixed shape, declare `first pass`, `rank all`, or `best-of` before spawning.
3. Set N from the user or derive it from the shape. N is total workers, not a host concurrency cap.
4. Pick the worker model from `swarm workers` in `~/.config/opencode/pstack-models.md` (or project `.opencode/pstack-models.md`) when present. Otherwise use `grok-4.6-fast-xhigh`. For a model race, name each arm's model up front.
5. Give each worker its own writable output when it writes. Use a worktree, branch, or `/tmp/swarm-<slug>/worker-<n>/`.

## Phase B: Fan out

Spawn all N workers in one message via the `task` tool with agent `general` (or `poteto-agent` when the worker implements), the configured model, and a standalone brief. Prefer an isolated worktree per writer. Isolation is the host's job (local session, worktree, or Docker). Do not pass foreign host-isolation fields. When a worker must start from a non-default branch, name that branch in the brief and have it check it out. Use a local child only when the worker needs this machine (browser MCP, simulators, local auth).

Every brief stands alone. Include the goal, scope, exact slice or race arm, how to verify, and what to report. Reports use `PASS`, `ISSUES`, or `BLOCKED` with evidence.

If a worker drops out, proceed with N-1 and note it.

## Phase C: Aggregate

Read the terminal results. For coverage, every required slice needs a result. For a race, apply the selection rule declared up front. Use first pass, rank all, or best-of. Do not paste raw worker dumps.

Keep a compact result table, one-line evidenced issues, and explicit gaps or dropouts.

## Phase D: Report

Return one consolidated in-chat report with the table, issue one-liners, gaps or dropouts, and the race rule when used.
